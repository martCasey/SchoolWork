Information Management 2017 referencing Assignment

Your task is to submit a 2 page summary of a field or topic in Computing in which you are interested. This can be around a project area that you are interested in or around another topic. 

You should include at least 6 references for your topic. Of these there should be 1 reference from a book, 1 reference from an academic journal, 1 reference from from a news article, 1 reference from a company white paper, one web reference and one blog or social media reference.

You should rate the references on a 'quality' scale (1 - lowest rating, 10 = highest rating) for the following qualities:

Authority (Well founded, well trusted)

Currency (Up to date)

Relevance (Relevant to your core topic/ idea)

Independence

Originality

Also outline which you think are the best references and why.



Some Tips on Topics: 

You may choose a topic relevant to your project area, this then helps with your project write-up.

You may choose a topic not relevant to your project in which your are interested.

There should be an aspect of IT in your topic, ideally discussing how changes in IT are impacting on the area.

Don't choose too wide a topics - eg 'Information Security' or 'Cloud Computing' -these are very wide topics which it is difficult to be original about (even 'Security in the Cloud' is too wide unless you are looking at something specific). Pick instead an aspect of a topic where you can show the work you have done.

NOTE: Submission date is as per Moodle. There will be no penalty for late submission before December 1 but uploads on time will attract a 10% bonus.
